Rising Temperature

Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 


Problem:
Find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.


Sol:
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2 ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
